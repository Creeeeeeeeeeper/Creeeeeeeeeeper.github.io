class="line">00:00:00</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">We make the best uh equipment, the best missiles, the best of everything. Uh the European nations know that. And we&#x27;ve made a deal today, and I&#x27;m going to have Mark speak about it, but we&#x27;ve made a deal today where we are going to be</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:00:15</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">sending them weapons and they&#x27;re going to be paying for them. We, the United States, will not be having any payment made. Uh we&#x27;re not buying it, but we will manufacture it and they&#x27;re going to be paying for it. uh our last meeting of</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:00:30</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">a month ago was very successful in that they agreed to 5% which is more than a trillion dollars a year. So they have a lot of money and they these are wealthy nations. They have a lot of money and they want to do it. They feel very</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:00:41</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">strongly about it and we feel strongly about it too, but we&#x27;re in for a lot of money and we just we don&#x27;t want to do anymore and we can&#x27;t. But we make the best and we&#x27;re going to be sending the best to NATO and in some cases to maybe</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:00:54</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">uh at Mark&#x27;s suggestion if we go to Germany where they&#x27;re going to send early on missiles and they&#x27;ll be replaced and NATO is going to take care of it. It&#x27;s going to be coordinated by uh NATO and they&#x27;re</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:01:07</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">going to work very much with Matt Whitaker who&#x27;s right here who&#x27;s a great ambassador and Matt&#x27;s going to be coordinate. You better do a good job, Matt. I will.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:01:14</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">But Matt&#x27;s going to coordinate. He&#x27;s a very talented guy. He&#x27;s going to coordinate everything. So, in a nutshell, uh we&#x27;re going to make top-of-the-line weapons and they&#x27;ll be sent to NATO. NATO may choose to have</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:01:27</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">certain of them sent to other countries where we can get a little additional speed where the country will release something and be it&#x27;ll be mostly in the form of a replacement. And uh I&#x27;d like to have Mark and again</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:01:39</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">just a highly respected pretty young guy pretty young guy for having had the career that he&#x27;s had because he had he had an amazing career before going to NATO. So uh and we spent a lot of time together over the last couple of months</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:01:55</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">and if you could say a few words of Absolutely. Now Mr. President, dear Donald, this is really big. This is really big. You called me on Thursday that you had taken a decision uh and the decision is that you want Ukraine what</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:02:09</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">it needs to have uh to maintain to be able to defend itself against Russia, but you don&#x27;t want the Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical. Um and this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO summit uh the 5% but</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:02:25</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">also the decision to keep Ukraine strong and the decision to increase our defense industrial production. So based on that this is that was Europe stepping up. This is again Europeans uh stepping up. So I&#x27;ve been in contact with many</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:02:39</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">countries. I can tell you that at this moment, Germany massively, but also Finland and Denmark and Sweden and Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, they all want to be part of this. And this is only the first</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:02:51</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">wave. There will be more. So, what we will do is work through the NATO systems to make sure that we know what Ukrainians need so that we can make packages. Of course, in a way, we discussed it this morning with Pete</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:03:02</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Hexet uh at the Pentagon, in a way that of course the US uh will on its stock piles necessary to defend this country. That&#x27;s absolutely clear. But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on really uh massive numbers of military</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:03:18</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">equipment both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, etc., etc. So if I was Vladimir Putin today and hear you speaking about what you were planning to do in 50 days and this announcement uh I</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:03:31</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations uh about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment if I was flooding the pudding. But when Ukraine I think this is really great news for that. So I really want to thank</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:03:43</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">you for that and it means Europe is paying for it. And again I mentioned all these countries we will deal with that. And exactly as you said it might also mean that countries will move equipment fast into uh Ukraine and then the US</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:03:57</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">later backing it uh because speed is of the essence here. So really thank you. This is important. You did a great job. That&#x27;s a really great job. Uh we&#x27;ve been very successful in settling wars. You have India,</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:04:10</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Pakistan. You have Rwanda and the Congo. That was going on for 30 years. India, by the way, in Pakistan would have been a nuclear war within another week. The way that was going, that was going very badly. And we did that through trade. I</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:04:24</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">said, &quot;We&#x27;re not going to talk to you about trade unless you get this thing settled.&quot; And they did. And they were both great, great leaders. And they were great. But, uh, Rwanda and the Congo, that was going on for 30 years. and uh</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:04:37</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">at least 7 million people killed and killed with a lot of pretty rough weapons like uh machetes, heads chopped off uh going on for many years. You couldn&#x27;t even get near the countries. Nobody wanted to get near. It&#x27;s so</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:04:51</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">frightening. And we got that one solved. Uh Serbia, Kosovo, got that solved. That was going to be one that was going to happen. And again, that was something I use. I use drape for a lot of things, but it&#x27;s great for settling wars. Uh</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:05:08</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">that was really very important. We&#x27;re working, Marco is working very hard with everybody here on uh the strip, the Gaza Strip. I call it the Gaza Strip. One of the worst real estate deals ever made. They gave up the ocean front property.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:05:22</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">One of the worst deals ever made, but it was supposed to bring peace and it didn&#x27;t bring peace. It brought the opposite. But uh we&#x27;re doing pretty well on Gaza. Steve Woodco is here and I I think we could have something fairly</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:05:35</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">soon to talk about and we solved another one uh one uh that we just seem to have Armenia and Azer Baan. It looks like that&#x27;s going to come to a conclusion, successful conclusion. Uh we worked on Egypt with our next door</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:05:54</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">neighbor who uh is a good neighbor. They&#x27;re friends of mine, but they happen to build a dam which uh closed up water going into a thing called the Nile. I think if I&#x27;m Egypt, I want to have water in the Nile. And we&#x27;re working on that</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:06:10</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">one. It&#x27;s a problem, but it&#x27;s going to get solved. They built one of the biggest dams in the world, a little bit outside of Egypt. You know about that? You&#x27;ve been hearing about that one. And uh that turned out to be a big problem.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:06:24</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">I don&#x27;t know. I think the United States funded the dam. I don&#x27;t know why they didn&#x27;t solve the problem before they built the dam, but it&#x27;s nice when the Nile River has water. They, you know, it&#x27;s a very important source of income</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:06:35</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">and life. It&#x27;s the life of Egypt, and to take that away is pretty incredible. But we uh think we&#x27;re going to have that solved very quickly. So, we do good. The only one we haven&#x27;t been able to get to yet is Russia.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:06:50</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">I&#x27;m not happy. And I will tell you that Ukraine wants to do something again. It&#x27;s a war that should have never started. If I were president, it never would have happened. I used to speak to President Putin about it a lot. It was</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:07:00</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">the apple of his eye. But once I saw what was going on, I said, you know, they&#x27;re going to they&#x27;re going to have a war here. I was outside. Election was rigged and I was outside looking in and I said, you know, that</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:07:13</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">thing&#x27;s going to be a war. Couldn&#x27;t believe it because what Biden said was the exact opposite of what should have been said. And it started and it&#x27;s a real mess. We&#x27;re losing I guess they&#x27;re losing five or 6 thousand people a day.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:07:27</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">It&#x27;s actually now more. I used to I was saying 5,000 a day. It&#x27;s actually more now. Mostly soldiers but a lot of people in cities and towns that are getting blown up to it&#x27;s a horrible war and it should be stopped. And so if it&#x27;s not</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:07:40</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">done, if we don&#x27;t have an agreement in 50 days, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing. secondary uh tariffs and they&#x27;re biting and I hope we don&#x27;t get to the point where we do, but I I&#x27;ve been hearing so much talk.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:07:52</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">It&#x27;s all talk. It&#x27;s all talk and then missiles go into Kiev and kill 60 people. Uh it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s got to stop. That&#x27;s got to stop. But uh the purpose of this is to say that this is a very big deal we&#x27;ve made. This is billions of</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:08:09</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">dollars worth of military equipment is going to be purchased from the United States going to NATO etc. And uh that&#x27;s going to be quickly distributed to uh the battlefield. Uh Ukraine will take it up and you know say what you want about</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:08:24</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Ukraine. uh when the war started, they had no chance. And they still would have had no chance if the equipment they they had the best equipment because we do make the best planes and missiles and we make the best military equipment in the</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:08:39</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">world by far. We have new things coming out that are beyond belief. And I&#x27;m very excited about the Golden Dome. It&#x27;s going to give us very strong protection. We&#x27;ve already started that. But but uh but they had courage cuz somebody has to</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:08:56</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">use that equipment and they fought with tremendous courage and they continue to fight with tremendous courage but uh they don&#x27;t have they&#x27;re losing on equipment and Russia&#x27;s really taking a very positive very very uh strong I mean</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:09:11</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">what they&#x27;ve done the last couple of weeks without military reasons that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing 700 drones a day missiles bombing cities this is not because of military goals it is just creating</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:09:23</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">panic, keeping people out of their sleeves, hating towns. It&#x27;s really terrible and it is meaning a lot of people lose their lives, but also the infrastructure. Whole cities being they&#x27;re wiping out the electric. It&#x27;s</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:09:35</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">going to take years to rebuild it. This is a that&#x27;s going to be the next problem because but that that&#x27;s going to take a long time. Cities, many of the cities are knocked down to the to the ground. Many of the people have left, but many</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:09:48</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">have stayed. I don&#x27;t know. They they actually stay. Most have stayed actually. It&#x27;s incredible that they stay and knowing that a missile could be hitting your apartment house and your apartment house that you&#x27;re sitting in</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:09:59</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">could collapse on top of you. And they do very heavy construction. They don&#x27;t use rebar. They do very thick concrete construction. This those are heavy buildings. Big buildings and heavy buildings and they collapse uh like like</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:10:12</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">they&#x27;re made out of paper. It&#x27;s unbelievable to see this happening with people so many people being killed. So, we think we&#x27;re going to make progress and uh we hope we&#x27;re going to make progress. In the meantime, we&#x27;re going</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:10:23</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">to get you good service on what you need and we really became friendly with NATO this last meeting. You know, we went from 2% to 5% which everyone said was not even a possibility. They weren&#x27;t paying 2%. Many of them were paying much</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:10:36</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">less than 2%. But even those since you became president all committed to the 2% before the summit and now collectively they committed to the 5%. That&#x27;s right. They did and they&#x27;ve been</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:10:45</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">uh very good and and I think I made a lot of friends over there. We had couple of days of very intensive talks and they&#x27;re great people. They&#x27;re leaders of countries, leaders of countries. Uh many of them great countries. Some of them</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:10:58</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">smaller countries but for the most part that&#x27;s very solid, strong countries and uh very successful. Some of them are among the most successful countries in the world. So that&#x27;s the story. We hope that&#x27;s going to have an impact on</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:11:13</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Vladimir Putin and we hope it&#x27;s going to have an impact on Ukraine also. We want to make sure that Ukraine does what they have to do. All of a sudden they have they may feel emboldened and maybe they don&#x27;t want you know this is a very</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:11:27</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">difficult situation. Ukraine wants a peace deal. I think so. And they will stay committed to that. There&#x27;s no doubt they want it. But the Russians have to be committed.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:11:34</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">They have to continue to want it though. Yeah. I I agree. We will, you and I will make sure of it. All of a sudden, they&#x27;re getting all You and I will make sure. We&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll make sure. I feel confident</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:11:42</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">that they will do what has to be done. Plus, we have certain parameters that both sides know and we already know what what should be done. So, I think that&#x27;s going to be uh it&#x27;s going to be very strong. We wanting peace. Uh any</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:11:56</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">questions, please? Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. What was the tipping point for you in making this decision? Was it a conversation with President Putin? Was it a piece of intelligence? And why are you giving 50</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:12:05</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">more days? I think the well I think it&#x27;s a very short period of time. I think they&#x27;ll forget I&#x27;ve just really been involved in this for not very long and uh and it wasn&#x27;t initial focus. </span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:12:17</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">This is again, this is a Biden war. This is a Democrat war, not a Republican or Trump war. This is a war that would have never happened. It shouldn&#x27;t have happened. A lot of people being killed. When the uh when the final numbers come in, you&#x27;re going to see a</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:12:30</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">lot more people are being killed in this war than than you think than you&#x27;ve been writing about. It&#x27;s a very deadly war. Very they&#x27;re all bad, but this is a very deadly war. Very the numbers are going to be far greater when an apartment</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:12:42</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">house comes down and they say two people were slightly injured. No, many people were killed and those numbers will be at some point accurately reported. So far, they&#x27;re not. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s a deadly war. Uh, I think</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:12:56</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">that you&#x27;re just going to see I think you&#x27;re going to see strong movement. I hope so. I hope so. And what about, you know, the uh secondary tariffs are very very powerful.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:13:06</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">What about the tariffs that the Republicans in the House and the Senate have ready? Those were 500%. Why are you doing 100%. Well, the Republicans are moving very strongly in the Senate, giving us total</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:13:18</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">control of it. But uh I I&#x27;m not sure we need it, but it&#x27;s certainly good that they&#x27;re doing it. And Lindsey Graham&#x27;s working hard, the whole re John, all of them, they&#x27;re all working hard and and they&#x27;re in coordination with Mike</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:13:33</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Johnson, uh speaker in the House, and I think they are they&#x27;ve actually crafted a pretty good piece of legislation. It&#x27;s probably going to pass very easily, and that includes Democrats. And there are some little tweaks, but uh I don&#x27;t want</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:13:49</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">to say I don&#x27;t need it because I don&#x27;t want them to waste their time. It could be very useful. We&#x27;ll have to see. But we can do uh we can do secondary. We&#x27;re probably talking about 100% or something like that.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:13:59</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Can you clarify? We can do secondary we could do secondary tariffs without the Senate, without the House, but what they&#x27;re crafting also could be very good. So are you suggesting then that the the</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:14:11</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Congress should move forward with those sanctions, the 500% and that your 100 would be a separate additional package? Yeah, I mean the 500 is, you know, sort of meaningless after a while because at a certain point it doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:14:24</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">not going to be, you know, is 100 100 is going to serve the same function. But um yeah, I have it at 100%. They may have it I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re going to end up with. They may have it at 100 too. They may have it at 500. Uh, but</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:14:38</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">they&#x27;re doing some good work in the House and I think in the House and the Senate and as you know they they&#x27;re coordinated and they can have it done quickly. They said they&#x27;ll have it as quickly as I need it. So, we&#x27;ll see.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:14:50</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">We&#x27;re talking to him. In fact, John Thun&#x27;s coming over later on to talk. Yeah, he&#x27;s going to he&#x27;s going to come over. Thank you, Mr. President. Is it your view that Vladimir Putin</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:14:59</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">mischaracterized his dedication to Is it your view that Vladimir Putin mis mis uh misguided mis um did not clarify did not clarify his intention to a peace deal and what what happens now in the next phase is there</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:15:16</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">we&#x27;re going to see I mean we&#x27;re going to go for a period of time maybe he&#x27;ll start negotiating and I think we felt I felt I don&#x27;t know about you Mark but I felt that we had a about four times.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:15:28</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Mhm. And here we are still talking about and he didn&#x27;t send serious people to the negotiation. So I remember that you uh were able with Marco Rubio and with Steve Vkov to get these talks going in</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:15:40</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Istanbul. I remember I was myself in TIA for NATO business in May. Um and we really put pressure on the Ukrainians to send a senior team into Istanbul and they did. But then uh the Russians came up with</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:15:53</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">this historian explaining history of of Russia since 1250. We thought and I thought we should had a deal done a long time ago. But it just keeps going on and on and on and every night people are dying. A lot</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:16:10</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">of people a lot of Russian soldiers are dying by the way and a lot of Ukrainian soldiers too. But a lot of Russian soldiers 100,000 Russian soldiers since 1st of January. Since January 100,000 Russian</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:16:23</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">soldiers dead since January. So if anybody in in Moscow is listening to this again, 100,000 dead Russians since January. This is what President Putin is doing at the moment. Yeah, please.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:16:36</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Will these be Patriot missiles specifically or Patriot batteries that you&#x27;re planning? And when do you It&#x27;s everything. It&#x27;s Patriots. It&#x27;s all of them. It&#x27;s a full complement with the batteries.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:16:45</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">And when do you expect them to arrive in Ukraine, sir? Well, we&#x27;re going to have some come very soon, within days actually, because a couple of the countries that have patriots are going to swap over and</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:16:56</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">we&#x27;ll replace the Patriots with the ones they have and uh Matt will coordinate with NATO, but so it&#x27;s going to be they&#x27;re going to start arriving very And this this afternoon Boris Ptorius the German defense minister is visiting Pete</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:17:09</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Hexetive defense and we&#x27;ll discuss also I think on this whole patriot thing Norway is involved so that&#x27;s on the Patriots but this whole deal is also about missiles or ammunition. So it&#x27;s broader than the</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:17:21</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">patriots. We have one country that has 17 patriots getting ready to be shipped. They&#x27;re not going to need them for that. So, we&#x27;re going to work a deal where the 17 will go or a big portion of the 17 will go to</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:17:34</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">the war side. Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, that could be done very quick. Mr. President, Mr. President, yeah, please.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:17:40</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Could this transaction with NATO be viewed as a step towards achieving peace, letting Putin know that now uh Zwinsky has a little bit more powerful tools in his tool chest and maybe that brings him to the table to achieve</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:17:54</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">peace. I know that you wanted to do that, Brian. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been saying. I think you might have expressed it better if you wanted the truth. Exactly. Give us a summary.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:18:03</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">That was a nice summary. You might I think he&#x27;s done better than us. He&#x27;s he&#x27;s a very good guy. I can tell you that. But uh no, it&#x27;s well well said. Yeah, I think this is uh a chance at getting peace or it&#x27;s just going to be</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:18:17</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">the same thing. I I have to tell you Europe has a lot of spirit for this war. A lot of people, you know, when I first got involved, I really didn&#x27;t think they did, but they do. And I saw that a month ago, and then you were there. Most of</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:18:31</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">you, many of you were there. The level of uh a spreeor spirit that they have is amazing. They really think it&#x27;s a very very important uh thing to do or they wouldn&#x27;t be doing. Look, they&#x27;re agreeing to just, you know, they&#x27;re</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:18:47</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">paying for everything. We&#x27;re not paying anymore. We were we have an ocean separating us. I said, &quot;We have a pro. We We make the best stuff, but we can&#x27;t keep doing this.&quot; And Biden should have done this years ago. He should have done</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:18:59</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">it from the beginning, but he didn&#x27;t. He didn&#x27;t know he was there. This guy, what a what what a horrible job they did for this country. And I just hope between the border and this and so many other inflation, what a horrible</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:19:13</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">administration. The worst administration in history in my opinion. It&#x27;s not my opinion. I think it&#x27;s everybody&#x27;s opinion. But this is something that shouldn&#x27;t have happened and we&#x27;re going to see if we can end it.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:19:24</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">If I could follow, I I do want to make one statement again. I said it before. This is not Trump&#x27;s war. We&#x27;re here to try and get it finished and settled and whatever because nobody wins with this. This is a</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:19:37</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">loser from every standpoint from day one. This was Biden and this was other people. And uh it&#x27;s very sad. It&#x27;s very sad situation. This gentleman is doing a</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:19:49</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">great job. He&#x27;s gonna I think he&#x27;s going to get it. And Matt and everybody else that&#x27;s working on it. I think you&#x27;ll get this thing over with hopefully. Mr. President, Mr. President, you&#x27;ve praised European countries today as</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:20:00</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">standing up for Ukraine as being strong. Will you uh allow them to continue to negotiate tariffs lower than 30% before August 1st? Or is the deal set at this point? What does that mean? You mean you&#x27;re</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:20:09</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">talking about the tariff on You&#x27;re back on tariffs. They&#x27;re on a more friendly tariff, right? a little bit more friendly to No, we&#x27;re going to be talking to people. We have, you know, I I watched the show</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:20:23</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">this morning. They were talking about, well, when&#x27;s he going to make the deal? The deals are already made. The letters are the deals. The deals are made. There are no deals to make. They would like to do a different kind of a deal. And we&#x27;re</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:20:33</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">always open to talk. We are open to talk, including to Europe. In fact, they&#x27;re coming over. They&#x27;d like to talk to us. Mr. President, is there any concern about the US stockpiles? there was a pause in</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:20:45</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">delivery of uh weaponry to Ukraine in order to evaluate apparently the US stockpiles. What came out of that evaluation? I mean this was a very big what we&#x27;re talking about today is a very very big day and uh what Pete was doing</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:21:02</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">and me too. I knew what Pete was doing uh was evaluation because we knew this was going to happen and now we actually announced it. They voted on it. It&#x27;s all been done. So obviously that has a big impact on, you know, when you say pause,</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:21:18</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">obviously you&#x27;re not going to be doing things if you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to happen here. But we were pretty sure this was going to happen. So we did a little bit of a pause, but this is a very big this is a very big event today.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:21:29</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">This is something Putin escalates further. How far are you willing to go in response? In what? In what? How far are you willing to go if Putin were to escalate send more bombs in the</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:21:39</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">coming days? Don&#x27;t ask me a question like that. How far? I don&#x27;t know. Like I I want to get the war settled. They&#x27;re not Americans that are dying in it and you know I have a problem and JD has a problem. It&#x27;s a stance that he&#x27;s had for</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:21:51</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">a long time. They&#x27;re not Americans dying but uh there are a lot of people dying and on something that should be able to be settled and we all agree with that. This group of people that you know we want to defend our country but you know</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:22:05</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">ultimately having a strong Europe is a very good thing. It&#x27;s a very good thing. So I&#x27;m okay with that. Yeah, please in the back. Yeah. Yeah. Is there a ceiling on what the Europeans are willing to pay for?</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:22:14</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">And it sounds like well are you ruling out the US paying for some from additional weapons through draw down authority? Should I try to answer because basically what the president is saying that he&#x27;s</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:22:25</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">willing of course taking in consideration what the US needs itself. So it&#x27;s not that you can have a shopping list and you can order whatever you want because the US has to make sure that the US keeps its hand on what the US needs</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:22:36</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">also to keep the whole world safe because in the end you are the police agent of the whole world. You&#x27;re the most powerful nation on earth, most powerful military on earth. U but given that uh the US has decided to indeed</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:22:47</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">massively supply Ukraine with what is necessary through NATO. Europeans 100% paying for that. And what we have been doing over the last couple of days is talking with countries and I just mentioned to once who in the first wave</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:23:00</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">immediately said we want to chip in and then you talk really talking about big numbers take Germany visiting today they&#x27;re really talking about big numbers can we get some clarity I will say I spoke with Germany spoke</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:23:15</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">with most of the larger countries and they are really enthusiastic about this they want to and you know they&#x27;re willing to go very far I will tell you, you know, as per your question, how far would I go? They they want to go very</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:23:28</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">far. They don&#x27;t want this to happen. That&#x27;s why I think from Putin&#x27;s standpoint, it would really be good. He gets the country&#x27;s economy is doing very poorly. And he&#x27;s got to get his economy back. He&#x27;s got to save his economy. He</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:23:39</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">could save his country in a sense, but the economy can destroy destroyed a lot of countries over the years. He wants to get that economy back. And you know, he&#x27;s got a great country for trading and other things. If they could use the</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:23:51</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">assets instead of war, uh, he&#x27;s got some tremendous potential. That&#x27;s what I would say. How did you deliver this news to Putin, sir? Say,</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:23:58</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">how did you tell Putin this was coming? Uh, I speak to him a lot about getting this thing done and I always hang up say, well, that was a nice phone call and then missiles are launched into Kiev or some other city. And I said, strange.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:24:14</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">And after that happens three or four times you say the talk doesn&#x27;t mean anything. My conversations with them are always very pleasant. They say isn&#x27;t that very lovely conversation. And then the missiles go off that night. I go</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:24:29</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">home. I tell the first lady you know I spoke to Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation. She said oh really? Uh another city was just hit. So, it&#x27;s like, look, he&#x27;s uh I don&#x27;t want to say he&#x27;s an assassin, but he&#x27;s a</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:24:45</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">tough guy. It&#x27;s been proven over the years. He&#x27;s fooled a lot of people. He fooled Bush. He fooled a lot of people. He fooled Clinton, Bush, Obama, Biden. He didn&#x27;t fool me. But what I do say is that uh at a certain point, you know,</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:25:01</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">ultimately talk doesn&#x27;t talk. It&#x27;s got to be action. It&#x27;s got to be results. And I hope he does it. Uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s potentially such a great country to be wasting so many people on on this and the money and look at what&#x27;s</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:25:18</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">happened to his economy. Look at what&#x27;s happened. So and with the threat in 50 days I mean he&#x27;ll be hit very hard. The first lady I mean look I hope he&#x27;s I hope he&#x27;s</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:25:27</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">going to do it. He knows the deal. He knows what a fair deal is. If there is such a thing as a fair deal, there can no there&#x27;s no winners here. This is a loser. This is a loser. And I I dealt with him from the beginning and it</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:25:42</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">wouldn&#x27;t have happened. But I will say it was Ukraine was the apple of his eye. We talk about it. It was the apple of his eye, but it wasn&#x27;t going to happen. And he understood that it wasn&#x27;t going to happen. And then I noticed after I</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:25:55</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">And then I noticed after I was out, I noticed soldiers forming at the border. And then I heard horrible stupid things being said from the other side and I said they&#x27;re really uh handling it very very wrong. It&#x27;s a shame. Yeah.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:26:09</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Can I say one thing and it is about President Trump because you can office in January on the 12th of February you had your f first call with Putin. I think you did exactly what I hope you would do that is breaking the deadlock</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:26:21</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">starting the conversation because you have to test him. I know Putin very well from the days I was prime minister in Netherlands. you have to test him and you did this and you really gave him a chance to be serious to get to the table</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:26:31</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">to start negotiations. Steve Whitio, we all trying to help you. Uh but you&#x27;ve now come to a point where you say, &quot;Well, hey, we actually thought we had probably four times a deal.&quot;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:26:42</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Yeah. I mean, you would have called and we said, &quot;This looks good.&quot; Yeah. And then the deal wouldn&#x27;t happen because bombs would be thrown out that</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:26:48</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">night and you&#x27;d say, &quot;We&#x27;re not making any deals.&quot; It was like, but you making the demo was crucial because you had to start that process and you were the only one who was able to do that.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:26:58</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">I think we&#x27;ll get it done. Do you think he&#x27;s reasonable enough to negotiate an end? I think we&#x27;re going to get it done. I think look, he he uh this is a very powerful situation. You</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:27:08</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">have very wealthy countries buying the best equipment in the world. And we have the best equipment in the world. We make equipment like no other. You know, our submarines, nuclear submarines are so powerful.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:27:22</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">They&#x27;re most powerful weapon ever built. And we have the best in the world by they&#x27;re 20 years behind, 25 years behind us. We have the greatest equipment anywhere in the world. I just hope we don&#x27;t have to use it. Yeah, please.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:27:37</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Thank you, Mr. President. Um, on a separate topic here, uh, President Biden of all people spoke to the New York Times over the weekend. He did not speak to them on the record during his time in office at all, but he spoke to them</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:27:49</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">recently and he defended his use of the autopen and said that he signed off on every decision. But at the same time, the Times reports that he did not individually approve each name for the categorical pardons that applied to</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:28:03</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">large numbers of people. What are your your take on that? Any new revelations from that? Well, I mean, you&#x27;re talking about the auto pen. Look, the autopen I think is maybe one of the biggest scandals that</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:28:14</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">we&#x27;ve had in 50 to 100 years. This is a tremendous scandal. And I know the people on the other side of the O see that desk, that Resolute desk. Unfortunately, he used it before me. But you know, we have our choice of seven</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:28:30</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">desks. They&#x27;re all beautiful, but I chose the Resolute and so did he, unfortunately. But the people on the other side of the Resolute Desk, I know them. Lisa, the whole group, and they&#x27;re no good.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:28:45</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">They&#x27;re sick people. And I guarantee you, he knew nothing about what he was signing. I guarantee it. So, they&#x27;re going to figure it out. And uh we&#x27;ll see what happens. But to me, the autopen, you know, you elected president, you</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:29:01</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">know what the autopen is supposed to do? sign thousands of letters from young people that write. I get we get thousands of letters a week, Susie, right? Thousands. I mean, tens of thousands sometimes. I look at a room.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:29:14</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">There&#x27;s a room where we have many, many people working responding and sending letters back. That&#x27;s what an autopen supposed to be. To write to a young sevenyear-old boy that writes to the president and he wants to be president</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:29:27</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">someday and he loves America. That&#x27;s what the autopen supposed to be. It&#x27;s not supposed to be for signing major legislation and all other things. No, the autopen and I doubt he knew. I doubt I doubt they even spoke to him about it.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:29:42</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">I think they they had if it&#x27;s called the freewheeling autopen like Biden was never for open borders. Biden was never for transgender for everyone. So, I don&#x27;t think he uh I think the radical left people that took they took</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:29:57</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">over the White House. And if I didn&#x27;t win, our country was finished. You know, when I was in and I said this a couple of times, I hope I don&#x27;t bore you with it, but when I was in Saudi Arabia, I was in Qatar, I was in UAE, and then I</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:30:11</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">met with all of your leaders. Yes, sir. Including you, a great leader. He&#x27;s now the leader of many countries, not just No, no, no. But uh but I met with a lot of leaders over the last two months uh in the Middle East and all the NATO all</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:30:28</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">of the NATO countries and I will tell you they had one common phrase. They thought America was dead one year ago and today they say and they all say it and I hope I hope you&#x27;ll back me up on this but they say now it&#x27;s the hottest</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:30:43</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">country anywhere in the world. It is. Look at our numbers. Look at the numbers we made. You see, we made 25 billion last month. We don&#x27;t we didn&#x27;t make that for years. Uh the tariffs are kicking in. The economy is very strong. Even</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:30:56</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">though we have a Fed person who&#x27;s terrible, he doesn&#x27;t know what the hell he&#x27;s doing. But that&#x27;s all right. We blew we blow through interest rates. We&#x27;re doing so well. We blow through it. Be nice because people would be able to</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:31:05</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">buy housing a lot easier. But uh think of it. We thought your country was dead. And they were dealing with China because they really they were really going to China. but not anymore. But uh we thought your country was dead and now</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:31:20</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">you have the hottest country anywhere in the world. So we&#x27;ve uh we&#x27;ve done a really good job and uh it&#x27;s an honor to have this man. This man is a star and he&#x27;s going to be dealing with another one of my stars, Matt. And you&#x27;re going</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">00:31:32</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">to do a great job, Matt Whitaker. Okay. Thank you very much everybody. Happy Thank you guys. Thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you very much.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
